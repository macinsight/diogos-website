				<p> In order to be the Greatest Lord in the desert, you must learn these simple yet essencial and indispensable key concepts that'll help you throughout the game.</p>
				<br>
				<img src="popularity.jpg" alt="Popularity symbols used in game.">
				<h3>Popularity</h3>
				<hr class="contentLine">
				<p>A happy castle is a good castle. Popularity is one of the keys to progress further in the game and make your castle grow. There are three popularity indicators:</p>
				<p style="padding-left: 25px"> • a green smiling face indicates that you'll receive a positive effect for a especific factor;</p>
				<p style="padding-left: 25px"> • a yellow blank face indicates that you won't receive any effect for a especific factor;</p>
				<p style="padding-left: 25px"> • a red sad face indicates that you'll receive a negative effect for a especific factor.</p>
				<p>All seven factors summed up will decide on whether you'll receive or lose popularity, the main factors being <b>food</b> and <b>taxes</b>. 
				But beware, once your popularity goes bellow 50, people will leave the castle.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Food</h3>
				<hr class="contentLine">
				<p>Food and rations are one of the most important resources in Stronghold. Without it, you'll be heavily penalised and lose popularity, resulting in your peasants leaving the castle.
				But it also means that food is one of the best ways to improve your popularity as well. Using the <b>granary</b>, its possible to change your peasants diet by changing their rations size and/or prohibiting them from certain foods.</p>
				<p>Reducing your rations amount below the default "normal rations" option, will result in a popularity loss. However, choosing an option above this one will result in a popularity gain.
				Supplying different types of food will also result in a positive popularity change.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Taxes</h3>
				<hr class="contentLine">
				<p>By clicking your castle's <b>keep</b> you can change your taxes. You can either bribe your peasants to stay or tax them to death using the power of feudalism.
				Choosing any of this options will have a positive or negative effect on your popularity, however if you choose to select the default option <b>"no taxes"</b> you'll have a positive popularity effect.
				The taxing system is one of the easiest ways to expand your castle's treasury.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Fear factor</h3>
				<hr class="contentLine">
				<p>The fear factor will determine how hard your peasants will work. There is a variety of good things and bad things to choose from:</p>
				<p style="padding-left: 25px"> • good things (like gardens and such) will give you a positive popularity effect. However your peasants will become lazy and your productivity will decrease, bringing less resources to the castle;</p>
				<p style="padding-left: 25px"> • bad things (punishment devices) will give you a negative popularity effect. However your peasants will fear your mighty hand of steel and work harder, increasing productivity and therefore bringing more resources to the castle.</p>
				<p>But this is Stronghold Crusader. You're the Lord of your castle and you may rule as harsh or as nice as you will.</p>
